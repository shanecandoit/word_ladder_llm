Word ladder (also known as Doublets, word-links, change-the-word puzzles, paragrams, laddergrams,
or word golf) is a word game invented by Lewis Carroll.

A word ladder puzzle begins with two words, and to solve the puzzle one must find a chain of other words to link the two,
in which two adjacent words (that is, words in successive steps) differ by one letter.

- head
- heal
- teal
- tell
- tall
- tail

## Why

This is mostly an exercise in prompt engineering at this point.

The ultimate goal is being able to produce self-directed word play as a reinforcement learning training data set.
